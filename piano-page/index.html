        <h1>Welcome to The Keyboard Room</h1>
        <p>Click on the keys to play the keyboard. After several keystrokes, you'll be prompted to share a concern. This experience illustrates how accumulated worries can be overwhelming, yet manageable by addressing them one by one.
            <br> On the left is a note taking section. So you can ponder upon your thoughts and worries and take notes on what you feel like or new thoughts that are being generated or maybe a way you can address them.
            <br> When you are ready to let go of a thought / worry, click on the floating thoughts and it will disappear.
